Operators and Expressions in python

Arithmetic operators
    + Addition
    - Subtraction
    * multiplication
    / Division
    % Modulus
    **Exponentiation

Comparison Operators
    ==Equal to
    != Not Equal !==
    >Greater than
    < Less than
    >= Greater than or equal to
    <= Less than or equal to

Logical Operators
    Logical AND 'and'
    Logical Not 'not'

Assignment Operators
    Assign value:'+='
    Subtract and assign value:'-='
    Multiply and assign value:'*='
    Divide and assign value:'/='
    Modulus and assign value:'%='
    Exponentiate and assign value:'**='

Membership Operators:
    In:'In' operator checks if a value exists in a sequence
    Not in:'not in' operator checks if a value does not exist in a sequence

Identity operators
    Is:'is' operator:checks if two values are the same
    Is not: 'is not' operator checks if two values are not the same

# Examples
# Addition
x = 20 + 10
print(x)

# subtraction
b = 4 - 2
print(b)

# Division
y = 20 / 2
print(y)

# Divide
z = 20 // 2
print(z)

# modulus
d = 20 % 2
print(d)

# Multiplication
e = 2 * 3
print(e)

# Exponentiate
f = 2 ** 4
print(f)

a = 2
c = 4
# Equal to
if a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
    print(a == b)

# Not equal to
if a != b:
    print("a is not equal to b")
    print(a != b)

# Greater than
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
    print(a > b)

# Less than
if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")
    print(a < b)

# Greater than or equal to
if a >= b:
    print("a is greater than or equal to b")
    print(a >= b)

# Less than or equal to
if a <= b:
    print("a is less than or equal to b")
    print(a <= b)

# Logical operators
a = True
b = False

# logical AND
print(a and b)

# logical OR
print(a or b)

# logical NOT
print(not a)
print(not b)

# Assignment operators
a = 19
# compound assignment operator

a += 5
print(a)

# Subtract and assign value
a -= 9
print(a)

# membered operator
cars = ['Jeep', 'Tesla', "BMW", 'RollRoyce']
if 'jeep' in cars:
    print("Jeep is in the list")
